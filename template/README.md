Visit the problem statement at [Advent of Code 2023 Day N](https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/N).

## Problem Statement

The problem for Day N involves solving a complex puzzle using algorithms and data structures. The puzzle is divided into two parts, each with its unique twist on the problem.

## Part 1

In Part 1, we are given a set of data and asked to perform certain operations on it. The goal is to find the solution that meets the criteria specified in the problem statement.

### Solution Overview

The solution for Part 1 involves using a specific algorithm to process the data. The algorithm takes into account the constraints of the problem and efficiently finds the solution.

## Part 2

Part 2 introduces a new twist to the problem. While the data set remains the same, the operations we need to perform on it change, making the problem more challenging.

### Solution Overview

The solution for Part 2 builds upon the solution for Part 1. It modifies the algorithm to account for the new operations and finds the solution that meets the new criteria.

## Challenges and Learnings

This problem presented several challenges, such as handling large data sets and optimizing the algorithm for efficiency. Through solving this problem, I learned more about the importance of choosing the right data structures and algorithms for a given problem.
